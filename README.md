# Information
Seen many ip grabbers that output to discord so I went and made one on telegram because discord is gay. If you need any support, pm my <a href="https://discord.com/users/630087545312509963">discord</a> or <a href="https://t.me/purelxw">telegram</a>

# Steps to run
`STEP 1:` Install telegram with the use of a phone number so have that ready.

`STEP 2:` Create a bot via BotFather (https://t.me/BotFather) with the message "/start" with the following message "/newbot" then follow the messages below with your own name and username:

`STEP 3:` To get your chat id, message my_id_bot (https://t.me/my_id_bot) with the message "/start", it will then pop up with the following message:

`STEP 4:` Put both the bot token and your chat id in the "main.php" file (ignore functions.php and config.php if your website doesn't have a root)
